# plu-ts-starter

this repository contains an initial setup to write Cardano smart contracts using the [`plu-ts` library](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts);

## Documentation

[here you find documentation on how to use `plu-ts`](https://www.harmoniclabs.tech/plu-ts-docs/index.html)

feel free to contribute to the [`plu-ts-docs` repository](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plut-ts-docs)

# Build the project

The remository is initialized with a basic comand to compile the typescript code you write;

in your shell, run:
```
npm run build
```

this will generate a `dist` directoru that contains the compiled output.

# Run the code

once you built the project (see above), run:
```
node dist/index.js
```
